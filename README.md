# ITransition-Task-3-Dice-Game
A console script that implements a generalized dice game.

## Introduction

Welcome to the General Non-Transitive Dice Game! In this game, players select dice with different faces and compete against the computer. The unique feature of this game is the non-transitive nature of the dice ‚Äì one die may beat another, but lose to a third. This makes the game both fair and strategic.

## Installation

Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dice-game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dice-game
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

## Game Setup

The game allows you to specify the number of dice and the number of faces for each die through the command line.


### Example Command:

```bash
python python game_dice.py 3,4,7,7,4,3 7,4,5,6,3,5 8,5,8,2,3,8
```

The first group of numbers (e.g. 3,4,7,7,4,3) represents a dice and its faces.
The second group (e.g. 3,4,7,7,4,3 7,4,5,6,3,5) must be separated by a space.
Make sure to specify valid configurations for a smooth game experience.

The game allows you to choose any number of dice (greater than 2) and the number of faces (greater than 6)

##Gameplay

Once the game starts, you'll be prompted to make a move by choosing a die and rolling it. You can also request help to view winning probabilities.

###Example of Gameplay:

1. Player's Turn: You select a dice configuration.
2. Computer's Turn: The AI selects a die and rolls it.
3. Result: The rolls are compared, and the winner is determined.

##Sample Output:
```bash
üé≤ Welcome to the General Non-Transitive Dice Game! üé≤
We will play with 4 dice(s) and 7 faces per die.

Let's determine who makes the first move! Or exit the game (x).
Guess my selection (0 or 1):
```

After this, you'll choose a die to roll, and the computer will do the same. The winner is the player with the higher total roll.

###Commands

- W: View the probabilities of winning with different dice configurations.
- X: Exit the game.
